Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is there as Ross enters with all his hair sticking
straight up.]
Ross: Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Rachel: Take the top down did ya?
Ross: Only way to fly.
(Rachel laughs.)
Rachel: Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what
shes talking about! I am an excellent driver!Ross: Youre fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.Rachel: Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
(A woman walks by and smiles at Rosss hair.)Ross: Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She mustve seen me
cruising in the bad boy.Rachel: I think shes checking out your beehive Ross.Ross: What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
Rachel: Gimme the keys!
Ross: No way!
Rachel: Well no brush!
Ross: Fine! Yknow what? It doesnt matter, because, if I remember
correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.(He goes to the bathroom and after he leaves Rachel goes through his coat and grabs the
keys along with a $20 bill. The woman from before watches her do this.)
Rachel: (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Phoebe are counting the invitations as
Chandler exits from the bathroom.]
Monica: Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.Chandler: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an
invitation.Monica: Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.Chandler: I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I
havent seen him in years.Monica: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!Chandler: Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the
same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.Phoebe: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Chandler: Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna
be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.Monica: So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I
dont care.Phoebe: Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
[Scene: A Street, Rachel is throwing her coat into the Porsche and getting in.]
Rachel: Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!
(Suddenly from out of nowhere Ross dives onto the hood.)
Rachel: My God!
Ross: What do you think youre doing?!Rachel: Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off
of the hood.)
Ross: There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why dont
you just hand over the keys?Rachel: Oh.
{Transcribers Note: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side
of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? Its a tradition left over from
Porsches racing history. The worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of
LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through
the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique
start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the
track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car,
buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that
took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the
steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts,
put the car in gear and start it. The drivers left hand did nothing. Porsche in
order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left
side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while
grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. Thats why every Porsche car built since
then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}Ross: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay!
Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the
twenty Rachel stole and doesnt find it.)Rachel: Look Ross, if youre so freaked out, just get in the car!Ross: With you?! Yeah right!
Rachel: All right. (She starts off.)
Ross: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
Rachel: What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Ross: In the death seat?!!
Rachel: Oh my(They drive off.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are on the couch as a man enters.]
Man: Hey guys!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey sweetie!
Man: Ready to go?
Phoebe: Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monicas. Ill be right
back. (She goes to get it.)Man: (stopping her) Wait a minute!
Phoebe: What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.
(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
Joey: So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Man: Over a month.
Joey: Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little
better.
Man: Sure, Id like that.Joey: So uh, whats your name?Man: (laughs) It's Jake.
Joey: Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Jake: Yeah, big fan.
Joey: Me too! Theres a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?Jake: Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure Im not doing anything
Tuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt
revealing a pink lace secret.)[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is entering from the bedroom carrying two bags of
luggage.]
Monica: Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
Chandler: Whats this?Monica: Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.Chandler: Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!
No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well
save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our
wedding be bigger please?Monica: Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two
talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.Chandler: Yknow we already went over this and I won!Monica: No you didnt. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that youre
marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.Chandler: Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see
him. I dont wanna.Monica: Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I knowChandler: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd
have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School,
he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing
speedosThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the
stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing
a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a
healthy snack!Monica: Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was
there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad.Chandler: He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!
Monica: Whos Mr. Garibaldi?Chandler: Does it matter?!
Monica: Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time
that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your weddingyoure
gonna regret it for the rest of your life.Chandler: Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.Monica: Yes!
Chandler: So I really never get to win anymore?
Monica: How much did ever really win before?
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Joey enters.]
Joey: Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean
forward I check out your underwear?Phoebe: Yeah!
Joey: Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens
underwear!Phoebe: I know. They were mine.
Joey: Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, thats weird!Phoebe: No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try
them on.Joey: Thats weird!Phoebe: Im wearing his briefs right now.Joey: Thatskinda hot.Phoebe: I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Joey: Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.Phoebe: And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually
more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.Joey: Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high
heels are good for his posture!Phoebe: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking
even more than you.Joey: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
Phoebe: Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his
masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! I dont think you could ever
do that.Joey: Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Phoebe: Okay, whatever.
Joey: Youve seen my huge stack of porn, right? (Phoebe nods.)[Scene: The Porsche, Rachel is driving along a highway and Ross has finally moved to
the death seat and is terrified.]
Rachel: God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my
license renewed.
Ross: (shocked) You dont have a valid drivers
licenseOkay that is it! Pull over right now!Rachel: Oh Ross youre so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to
relax all right? Just need to relax (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)Ross: (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are youOkay
thats not funny! Just stop horsing around!Rachel: I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.
(Suddenly a siren goes off behind them.)
Rachel: Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
Ross: Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that
much trouble.
Rachel: Really? You think so?
Ross: I was talking to myself! Youre going down![Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is walking from the bathroom to his bedroom and walks
past a pile of Rachels laundry, which just happens to include a selection of
panties. He stops, goes back to the basket, looks for Rachel, picks up a lavender thong,
and heads for his bedroom. However, he decides he doesnt like his selection and goes
back this time picking up a red low-cut silk brief and heads for his room, flexing along
the way to prove his masculinity.][Scene: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas and the strip before we
arrive at 4 Queens bar, where Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table waiting for the
show to start.

his leg.)

Rachel: (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
