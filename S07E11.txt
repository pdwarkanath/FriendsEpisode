cheesecake. The box it came in is also on the table.]Chandler: Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel: (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
Chandler: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Rachel: Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I(Chandler
puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,
this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to
look at the label on the box.)Chandler: (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent
it to us.
Rachel: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.
Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
Chandler: Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't
return a box after you've opened the box.Rachel: Why, why not?
Chandler: Because it's too delicious.
Rachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Chandler: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send
away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake
conglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible,
Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.Rachel: (taking a bite) Oh, Im sorry, what?Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone except Rachel is there as Joey gets up and starts
putting on his coat.]
Joey: All right, I should get going, big day at work. Yknow Im in a
coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.Chandler: SoJoey: Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, its just my character thats

Joey: Ill see you at 8:00.Phoebe: Okay. (Joey exits.)

discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe: Duly noted.

do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica: What are you talking about?
Ross: Cousin Frannies wedding, it's tomorrow night.Monica: You were invited?!
Ross: No.
Monica: My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were
invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were
inseparable!Chandler: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.Ross: Well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt
Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.Monica: Yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids
her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadnt
have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to.Ross: Yknow, she tried to undress me too.Chandler: I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then
shushes
him.)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, and Ross are playing Monopoly

you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?Phoebe: Oh thats a nickname we were trying out.Ross: Hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica
shakes her head in disgust.)Joey: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh! Heres Joseph Francis!Joey: Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Phoebe: So what?! That doesnt give you the right to ditch me!Joey: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for
sex!
Ross: Phoebe hes right, that is the rule.Phoebe: I dont accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show
up. Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!
Yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their
friendship) is for life!Joey: Wow! Im so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.Phoebe: Well, it does.
Joey: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? Im sorry. (They hug.) How
about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! Ill pay for myself!Phoebe: Okay, you wore me down.
Ross: Hey Joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the
Ross-A-Tron?Joey: The RossIs that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel enters to find Chandler staring at another
cheesecake box.]
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel: So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?Chandler: I cant seem to say goodbye.Rachel: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and
you want more?
Chandler: Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!Rachel: It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham
cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling (Pause) Wow! My
whole mouth just filled with saliva!Chandler: (closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are just
hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.Rachel: Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not
tempted.Chandler: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Rachel: Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the
cheesecake.)[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Joey are there. Joey is reading a newspaper.]

Monica: Joey, that papers like a year old!Joey: Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goodys sale is over?!Ross: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Ross: So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasnt
a mistake. Ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.Monica: Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Ross: Well yeah, but she doesnt know that. I mean, the last time she saw
you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.Monica: (disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! Thats
not the reason shes not inviting me!Ross: Oh whats the big deal?! I wasnt even invited to the ceremony,
just the reception. And-and yknow what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I
will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a
sign of protest.Monica: Joan?
Ross: Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. Shes an assistant professor in the
Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not
broad backed!Monica: Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasnt invited and
you got "and guest?!"Joey: Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Rosss behalf. I-I think
the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad backRoss: (interrupting) Not broad backed!
Monica: Wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!Ross: What? I cant cancel on Joan!Monica: Why not?!
Ross: BecDid you not hear me?! Shes an assistant professor in the

returning from lunch.]Chandler: Well, thank you for lunch.
Rachel: What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!Chandler: So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs
then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?Rachel: (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman
is still lying in front of her door.)
Chandler: Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
Rachel: She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.Chandler: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to
come back to bad cheesecake.Rachel: No that could kill her.
Chandler: Well, we dont want that.Rachel: No, so were protecting her.Chandler: But we should take it.
Rachel: But we should move quick.
Chandler: Why?
Rachel: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Chandler: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake
and they take off upstairs.)
