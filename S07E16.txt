Ross: I have a bone to pick with you.
Rachel: Uh-oh.
Ross: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Rachel: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old (She is waving her hand up and down
her face. Shes thinking about the pencil mark.)Ross: Thats right! Thats right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat

theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!Rachel: Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you dont think
thats just a little funny?!Ross: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught
him right?
Rachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are there.]
Phoebe: Its amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills

facial swelling, nausea, headacheHeadache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!
Now okay, I dont recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death

for legal reasons!
Phoebe: Why?
Monica: In case it happens.
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!

the proof of his ordination.)

Chandler: Our ministerPhoebe: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
Monica: Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her
torso.)
Phoebe: Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Joey: Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony,
do you wanna hear it?Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Yeah!
Joey: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the
piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to
celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like
it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving.
As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and
received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods
her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."Chandler: (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Commercial Break
[Scene: Carol and Susans, there is a knock on the door and Carol opens it to
reveal Rachel.]Carol: Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the
quarter trick with her as well.)
Rachel: Hi!
Carol: What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Rachel: Well yknow I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your
building and I thought to myself, "Whats up with Carol and sweet, little

Phoebe: I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
Monica: Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to
happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Phoebe: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
(Holds up the warning label.)
Joey: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Chandler: Yeah. O-okay.
Joey: (reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and
receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and
giving and" And then I cant think of a good word for right here. (He
points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)Monica: How about receiving?
Joey: Yes!
Chandler: See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things
about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!
Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!Joey: Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so
hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Chandler: No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)Joey: I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole
anything?
Phoebe: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the
eyes?
Monica: It doesnt say that!Phoebe: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!
Chandler: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic
stories. Nice stories.Joey: Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe Ill talk about London! Yknow

Joey: "by doin it."Chandler: Joe?
Joey: Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet
across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together

Monica: No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad

Monica: And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we
drank too muchJoey: Yeah baby!
Chandler: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and
said goodnight.
Joey: Oh.
Chandler: But then later that nightJoey: Yeah baby!
[Cut to London, Chandlers hotel room. He is getting ready for bed by doing
push-ups. One push-up. Just as he gets under the covers, theres a knock on the
door.]Chandler: (answering the door) Hey!
Monica: (standing outside) Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up
here in London huh?Chandler: Well I was I wasn't exactly expecting company after(He looks
at his watch.) 9:15.Monica: (entering) Is Joey here?
Chandler: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the
bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about
what that guy told ya are ya?Monica: Wouldnt you be?Chandler: Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and
youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I
mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!Monica: Really?
Chandler: You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms
(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going
on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?Monica: Well, not anymore.
Chandler: But we dont do that.Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler: How drunk are you?
Monica: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you
should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler: (thinks) Thats the perfect amount!Monica: Okay!
(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)
Monica: (breaking the kiss) Yknow whats weird?Chandler: What?
Monica: This doesnt feel weird!Chandler: I know.
Monica: Youre a really good kisser.Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna
get under the covers?
Monica: Hm-hmm!
Chandler: Okay!
(They do so and they take off their clothes.)
Monica: Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica: Were gonna see each other naked.Chandler: Yep!
Monica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler: Count of three?
Monica: One!
Chandler: Two!
Monica: Two!
Monica and Chandler: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other
out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
Chandler: Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively
ruined.Monica: Eh, we werent that close anyway!Chandler: Eh!
(They start making out again, and it takes Joey trying to enter to stop them.)
Chandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers
as Joey enters. Remember?)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV is

Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Hey listen, why dont you come downstairs with me? Theres some
really nice girls down there.Chandler: No I-I-Im fine.Joey: All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
[Cut back to Monica and Chandler telling Phoebe and Joey the story.]
Joey: Thats what that was?! Cause that other thing? I thought you
were on to something, but it did nothing for me.Monica: Okay, can we change the topic? Because its really doing
nothing for me.Joey: Oh (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadnt left you that last
one? You two mightve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent
that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! Its like it was in the stars!Phoebe: Yeah, its totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you
originally wanted to hook up with that night.Monica: What?!
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: (To Joey) What?!
Chandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Monica: Okay, fine but please dont be upset! Okay? I was really
depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just
wantedjust sex. So, when Iwent to your room that nightI was actually
lookingfor Joey. (Joey smiles.)Joey: Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!

Ross: I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff
