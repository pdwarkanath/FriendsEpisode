moves Monica to the side and away from the nurse.)
Monica: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Chandler: Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.Monica: What?
Chandler: Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im
not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it.

Monica: Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but
maybe its right.Chandler: What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!Monica: What?!!
Chandler: Im kidding. This is going to be fun.Monica: So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?Chandler: Were trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler

whats he like. People tell doctors everything.Joey: But you said he was this great guy!
Phoebe: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn

(They start making out again.)
Monica: (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!

contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
Dr. Long: Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.Rachel: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you
