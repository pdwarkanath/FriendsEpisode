a Ross.Phoebe: Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not 
everything has to go as far as eye contact.[Scene: Monica and Chandlers apartment]Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.
Chandler: Dont you think its better for him to think that youre cheating 
on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!Monica: I dont want him to think that I'm having an affair.Chandler: Alright. Ive got a plan. Ill go down the fire escapeMonica: Yes. Because all good plans start with Ill just go down the fire 
escapeChandler: Hear me out, woman! Ill go down the fire escape, then Ill wait

here.Monica: Arent you afraid that Joeys going to figure all this out? [Silence]

Rachel was not whiney enough.

with Ross. I should just move on with my life.
