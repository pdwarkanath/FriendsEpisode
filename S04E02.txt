and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cats eyes) Oh my God.Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Nothing. Nothing.
Joey: What? Whats wrong?Phoebe: I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my
Mother.
Rachel: You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Phoebe: No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom
Lily, the one who killed herself.
Ross: Are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your
grandmas glycoma medicine again?Phoebe: No Dr. Skeptismo! Im sure. First of all, okay, theres the
feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my
guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My
Mothers favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then
nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to
the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an Oh my God. gesture) Oh, I
havent seen this smile in 17 years!Joey: (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni...Chandler: (interrupting) Let it go!!
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is working as Monica enters.]
Monica: Hey!
Rachel: Umm, when were you gonna tell me that youre going out with Chip
Matthews?Monica: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel: Nooo! Its not okay! I cant believe you would want to after
what he did to me!Monica: What, that little thing at the prom?
Rachel: Monica! I couldnt find him for two hours! He was having sex with
Amy Welch!Monica: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica: Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Rachel: Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high
school.Monica: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off
Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band
uniform they had to have specially made.Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
Monica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out
with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. And the
fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.Rachel: Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) 
Monica: Oh, really?!
Rachel: Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go
have sex with another guy?Monica: Ill try.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]
Ross: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey: Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think
any of them are gonna work out.Chandler: Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not
everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Phoebe: (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,
trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe: Well, Im not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to
the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think shes worried that
y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)
Well, thats not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in
the other room.Monica: Why cant you use the phone in here?Phoebe: Well, Im returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I
just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicas room)Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?Monica: Ross, dont start.Ross: Come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that
theres a woman inside that cat!Rachel: I believe it.
Ross: No you dont.Rachel: Yes, I do.
Ross: No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.Rachel: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Ross: I do not always have to beokay, okay. (starts to leave)Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.
(Ross wants to say something, but just smiles and leaves.)

Weve got a canoe.(Joey jumps up in excitement and without turning around Chandler holds out his hand
stopping him, and ushering him back into his seat. Joey sits down, dejected.)
Chandler: Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.Tony: You gotta take the canoe!
Chandler: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you
get home, throw the canoe away!
Peter: Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as
Tony chases after him)Joey: (to Peter) Good for you!!

Rachel: (entering) You guys, youre never gonna believe what I just found

Julio.Rachel: You guys, theres a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I
mean, you know what that means?!Joey: (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Rachel: Do we have to tell her?
Ross: Yes, we have to tell her!
Monica: Oh, but its made her so happy.Ross: (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have
dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
All: (disappointed) Yeah.
Ross: Thank you.
