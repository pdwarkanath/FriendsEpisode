[Scene: Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone 
rings.]
Chandler: (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) 
Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when 
he speaks again) Hello?
Monica: (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Chandler: Honey, you're screaming.
Monica: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The 
kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Chandler: (yawning) Oh, that's great.
Monica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica 
clean.
Chandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.
Monica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's 
the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest 
guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in 
bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while 
Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]
Mike: This is nice.
Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and 
then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of 
Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
Mike: You need both hands for that?
Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she 
takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts 
it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they 
hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, 
holding hands.)
Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... 
holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, 
start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say 
nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming 
forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? 
Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... 
having that conversation.
Mike: Is it?
Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?
Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about 
someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone 
like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He 
tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks 
in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... 
that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that 
happens, you know... Think no note's there...
Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking 
for. A key.)
Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five 
dollars.
Mike: It's to my apartment.
Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and 
Mike.
Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your 
key just because...
Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.
Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from 
her bag.)
Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone 
that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike 
look really proud.)
Mike: Is this cool, huh?
Phoebe: It really is.
Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little 
things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks 
at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, 
interviewing a nanny candidate.]
Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like 
our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. 
The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem 
pleased with the answer.)
Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
Prospective nanny: Not really.
Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up 
and make their way to the door)
Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts 
playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?
Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three 
days notice.
Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross 
crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit 
down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the 
uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?
Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a 
"gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! 
Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood 
education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.
Ross: And she's a little mannish...
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens 
it.]
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!
David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! 
What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the 
people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their 
money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.
David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the 
airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... 
I... I didn't even think about it.
Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
David: Damn it!
Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just 
stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it 
goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing 
that I'm looking at: wow!
Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look 
pretty good.
David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a 
long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking 
about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. 
(Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe 
is still up on a cloud from what David just said)
Phoebe: No...
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe 
is pacing up and down the room.]
Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell 
David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.
Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking 
in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's 
just, he's so irresistible.
Monica: Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe: Really? Chandler?
Monica: Continue...
Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see 
him tomorrow night.
Monica: Phoebe!
Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so 
much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that 
you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long 
search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica: What are you gonna do?
Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen 
between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, 
no wrong...
Monica: You have to tell David!
Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]
Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, 
right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... 
(laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he 
enters)
Monica: Heeeeeey! 
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner 
state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who 
also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? 
Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. 
But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?
Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the 
way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)
Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... 
pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop 
there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could 
be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, 
that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told 
you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Chandler: Yeah, he came up...
Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was 
Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in 
a laugh)
Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?
Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]
Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with 
another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has 
got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
Rachel: Ross!
Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm 
engaged actually.
Rachel: Oh!
Sandy: Her name is Deliah.
Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.
Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really 
believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a 
child.
Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.
Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I 
got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see 
you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That 
was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his 
heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to 
comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over 
him)
Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to 
cry.)
Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I 
love him, I love him...
Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we 
shouldn't try him out.
Ross: Because, it's weird!
Rachel: Why?
Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman 
wanted to be...
Rachel: (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?
Ross: King?
Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on 
Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. 
Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)
Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) 
YES! Sandy you're hired.
Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of 
his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's 
just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Ross: You gotta be at least bi...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when 
Chandler enters.]
Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his 
finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to 
finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I 
need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood 
doesn't depend on it.
Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why 
are we doing this?
Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever 
met.
Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?
Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Chandler: Yeah!
Joey: Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares 
at him. At this moment Monica enters)
Monica: Hi! There you are.
Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns 
to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, 
who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of 
wine.]
David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Phoebe: Oof...
David: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants 
to kiss her.)
Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!
David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded 
sexy in my head, so I...
Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember 
when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His 
... his name is Mike.
David: Oh... oh...
Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.
David: No... well, yeah.
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy 
with this guy?
Phoebe: I am happy.
David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... 
But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I 
don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably 
uhm... go...
Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... 
you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to 
do.
David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik 
carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that 
also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek 
wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
David: No... no...
Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the 
door and turns around again)
David: In Minsk...
Phoebe: Yeah?
David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the 
lips.
Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each 
cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... 
(and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They 
kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy 
holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away 
with handkerchiefs]
Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) 
Hi...
Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?
Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me 
about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.
Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)
Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why 
do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and 
sighs)
Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? 
I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He 
is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... 
(looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.
Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy 
makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly 
cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from 
the cookie)
Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never 
thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta 
tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the 
living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy 
play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only 
sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door 
he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the 
living room.]
Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not 
bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Phoebe: No, no. No.
David: But... ergo...
Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably 
still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I 
really care about him...
David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David 
holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a 
bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to 
believe what's happening)
Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross 
enters.]
Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and 
bakes Madeleines?
Monica: Oh... How are they?
Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) 
But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Ross: Thank you!
Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and 
Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy 
from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica: Yeah, so?
Ross: Wow!
Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that 
is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing 
is... (he can't come up with anything)
Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's 
feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler: What are you guys talking about?
Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound 
like "Can you believe that?")
Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts 
laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches 
Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy 
again.)
Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a 
male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more 
pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away 
tears)
Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, 
you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns 
to Joey)
Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing 
hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
Joey: Yeah....
Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away 
from the kitchen)
Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're 
more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and 
limericks...
Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose 
wife made him die inside.
Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke 
you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy 
eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. 
Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)
Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross: Yep! That's my thing...
COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]
Mike: So... how many guys have your key?
Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it 
looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Mike: Your lipstick's on his mouth.
David: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Phoebe: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he 
lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Mike: Did you uhm...
Phoebe: No, no... 
Mike: ...kiss him?
Phoebe: Oh, well, yeah...
David: Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact 
I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. (he points at 
Mike)
Mike: Don't point your finger at me.
David: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits 
David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their 
fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and 
Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just 
go.
David: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at 
Mike) well, you just better watch out.
Mike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
David: Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Mike: Well, I might.
David: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely 
there.
Phoebe: Okay, well... guys?
David: Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)
Mike: Hey, what are you kidding me?
David: Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. (and he 
leaves)
Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I 
totally understand.
Mike: It's never gonna happen again right?
Phoebe: Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David 
comes in again.)
David: I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, 
that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll party up 
Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
[Scene: Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his 
own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and 
Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]
Joey: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross 
Buns.
Ross: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Joey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in 
position on the recorder)
Ross: (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is 
in shock)
Sandy: Who's up for puppets?
Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!
Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. 
Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate 
puppets?
Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their 
cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to 
Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of 
angrily says...)
Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)
Ross: (shakes his head) Oh my God!
Sandy: Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... (Ross goes to the 
kitchen)
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and 
opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]
Rachel: That was kind of rude!
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for 
me.
Rachel: You know, he was just doing his job...
Ross: Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love 
with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with 
this.
Rachel: Oh, come on Ross...
Ross: No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire 
someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Rachel: (sighs) Oh... That's true.
Ross: Thank you!
Rachel: Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to 
do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
[Scene: Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]
Sandy: (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important 
to shaaaaaaare...
Joey: (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the 
dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]
Chandler: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny 
Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/.
Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really 
sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, 
people!
Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler: I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) 
And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.) 
Joey: Allright. See you later!
Chandler: See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
Joey: (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica: Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I 
swear... a little pee came out.
[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and 
Rachel walk into the living room.]
Ross: Here goes...
Rachel: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where 
Sandy sits)
Ross: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not 
working out.
Sandy: (surprised) Oh...
Ross: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... 
uhm... We just feel...
Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. 
We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other 
families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!
Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... 
Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's 
something I can work on in the future.
Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my 
issue.
Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...?  ( h e   t i l t s   h i s   h e a d ) / P >
